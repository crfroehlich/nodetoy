Node toy is a node server that does JSON CRUD, so you can write desktop APPs that use the browser by writing just HTML and JavaScript.
<br/><br/>

The server has no database, JSON is stored directly on the file system.
<br/><br/>

The server responds to AJAX requests containing JSON and follows <b>REST</b> principals.

<h3>The Rules</h3>

All requests to process JSON data must start with /data/.
<br/><br/>

If you <b>POST</b> {"userID" : 1, "Bob"}  to  /data/user/Bob.json
<br/>
The server will create a file called users/Bob.json in the directory configured to store data.
<br/><br/>

The JSON can be retrieved by doing a <b>GET</b> from /data/user/Bob.json
<br/><br/>

The file is deleted by sending a <b>DELETE</b> to /data/user/Bob.json.
<br/><br/>

To get a list of all the <b>*.json</b> files in a directory send a GET to the directory /data/user/.

<h3>The Test Page</h3>
If that was not simple enough already you can try it out using the test page at 
<br/><a href="/app/test.html">/app/test.html</a> before you write any JavaScript.
<br/>This gives you a GUI view of the requests.
<br/><br/>

The server also serves HTML, CSS, JS and images from a directory called /app/ this is where you add your front end code.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Configuration is simple there is an XML file conf/config.xml containing a few variables including the port to listen on, the location of /app/ and the location of /data/
<br/><br/>

You can add other paramters in config if, is made available as JSON if you send a <b>GET</b> to /config/
<br/><br/>

<h3>Server Side Includes</h3>
All HTML has SSI includes processed, although the full spec of Apache SSI is not supported, including files and variables is.
<br/><br/>
You can add variables to the SSI environment (Like Apache&apos;s SetEnv command) by editing the /config/ssi-environment.xml file.

<h3>Security</h3>

There is no security, there are no users, no logins and all files are accessible even if the files are not JSON.  
If that bothers you, use a firewall.
<br/><br/>

If your app ever grows up to the extent that you want to publish on t'internet it you can add a security filter.
