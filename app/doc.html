Node toy is a server that does JSON CRUD, so you can write desktop APPs that use the browser by writing just HTML and JavaScript.
<br/><br/>

The server has no database, JSON is stored directly on the file system.
<br/><br/>

The server responds to AJAX requests containing JSON and follows <b>REST</b> principals.

<h3>The Rules</h3>

All requests to process JSON data must start with <code>/data/</code>.
<br/><br/>

If you <b>POST</b> <code>{"userID" : 1, "Bob"}</code>  to  <code>/data/user/Bob.json</code>
<br/>
The server will create a file called <code>users/Bob.json</code> in the directory configured to store data (by default, ./data).
<br/><br/>

The JSON can be retrieved by doing a <b>GET</b> from <code>/data/user/Bob.json</code>
<br/><br/>

The file is deleted by sending a <b>DELETE</b> to <code>/data/user/Bob.json</code>.
<br/><br/>

To get a list of all the <b>*.json</b> files in a directory send a GET to the directory <code>/data/user/</code>.

<h3>The Test Page</h3>
If that was not simple enough already you can try it out using the test page at 
<br/><a href="/app/test.html">/app/test.html</a> before you write any JavaScript.
<br/>This gives you a GUI view of the requests.
<br/><br/>

The server also serves HTML, CSS, JS and images from a directory called <code>/app/</code> this is where you add your front end code.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Configuration is simple, there is an XML file conf/config.xml containing a few variables including the port to listen on, 
the location of /app/ and the location of /data/
<br/><br/>

You can add other parameters in the config file, the whole file config it is made available as JSON if you send a <b>GET</b> to /config/
<br/><br/>

<h3>Server Side Includes</h3>
All HTML has SSI includes processed, although the full spec of Apache SSI is not supported, including files and variables is.
<br/><br/>

You can add variables to the SSI environment (Like Apache&apos;s SetEnv command) by editing the <code>/config/ssi-environment.xml</code> file.

<h3>Security</h3>

There is no security, there are no users, no logins and all files are accessible even if the files are not JSON.  
If that bothers you, use a firewall.
<br/><br/>

If your app ever grows up to the extent that you want to publish on t'internet it you can add a security filter.
<br/><br/>


<h3>Example</h3>
At <a href="/app/todo.html">/app/todo.html</a> there is a simple browser app designed for the FireFox sidebar as an example.
